# Spam Email Detection

This project is focused on detecting spam emails using machine learning. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we classify emails as "spam" or "not spam," helping to filter unwanted emails effectively.

## Project Overview
The spam email detection project classifies emails as either spam or legitimate using techniques such as Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. The model analyzes the textual content of emails, learning to distinguish patterns commonly found in spam messages.

## Dataset
The dataset includes labeled emails marked as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam). Each email is represented by its content, including subject lines and body text.

**Data Source:** Common public datasets for spam detection such as [SpamAssassin Public Corpus](https://spamassassin.apache.org/publiccorpus/).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/als138/Spam-Email-Detection.git
   cd Spam-Email-Detection
   ```
## Features
The project uses NLP techniques to preprocess and analyze text data, including:
- **Text Cleaning**: Removing unnecessary symbols, punctuation, and stopwords.
- **Tokenization and Vectorization**: Using methods like TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Generating additional features that capture patterns of spam.

## Modeling
The project employs machine learning algorithms, primarily **Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression**, to classify emails. The models are trained on labeled data and evaluated for accuracy and efficiency in identifying spam emails.

#### Performance Metrics
Evaluation metrics include:
- **Accuracy**: Measures the percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision and Recall**: Focus on the model’s performance specifically in identifying spam.
- **F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall to provide a single measure of performance.

## Results
The model effectively identifies spam emails with high accuracy. Key metrics are as follows:
- **Accuracy:** 90%

## Usage
To run the model and perform data analysis:
1. Open `Untitled.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Untitled.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the notebook steps to explore the dataset, preprocess data, and train the model.
3. Evaluation metrics and results will be displayed within the notebook.
